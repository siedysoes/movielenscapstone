HarvardX: PH125.9x: Data Science - Capstone - 
This capstone project is an exploration of a MovieLens dataset that tries to help find movies for users based on ratings that others have left for movies. We experiment with creating a recommendation system, that will minimize the RMSE score. and then extracting new features from the data to try and get better predictions.
